# Brief:  Choose how to ask for GPG passphrase (via terminal or GUI) based on
#         whether this instance of GPG is called via terminal or not.

# This variable is declared in the zshrc file and its default value allows the
# usage of pinentry-tty. If any other script needs a graphical pinentry then it
# needs to either unset or overwrite this value.
