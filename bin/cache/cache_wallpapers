# Brief:  Save the paths of all available images in the wallpapers directory
#         into a cache file.
#         This file will be read from the menu utility when needed.
#         The purpose of this is to speed up the creation of the list of
#         wallpapers the user can choose from.
#         This script is called both on login and at regular intervals by a cron
#         job.


# Make sure that the script won't be executed more than once at a time.
